Conclusions 
For IA-8 and IA-10 the times are comparable, the only difference is that the Backtracking solution always delivers the right result.
For IA-50 and IA-100 the backtracking option is not really an option anymore since it takes a lot of time to compute results wheareas 
	the NS Algo is fast and pretty accurate most of the times by giving only an approximate solution which is the local minimum of the initial solution.
